## Python PORT SCANNER

portscanners are primarly used for Pentesting and Information Gathering. Essentieally, we are looking for open ports in host for one of two reasons. To ensure our servers are secure or to exploit those of someone else. An unncessarily opened portmeans vulnerability and comes with a lack of security.
